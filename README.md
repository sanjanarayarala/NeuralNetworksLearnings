# NeuralNetworksLearnings

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to implementing and understanding neural network concepts from scratch without relying on deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, as I follow YT lectures, and compare with how neural networks are implemented with DL frameworks. The primary goal is to build a strong foundation in neural networks by implementing key concepts using only fundamental Python capabilities and NumPy.

## Why This Repository?
In the era of powerful deep learning frameworks, it's easy to use high-level APIs without fully grasping the underlying mechanics. By developing neural networks from first principles, this repository aims to:
- Deepen conceptual understanding of neural networks.
- Reinforce mathematical foundations behind training, backpropagation, and optimization.
- Gain hands-on experience in implementing every step manually.

## Key Topics Covered
This repository will cover the following core topics in neural networks:
1. **Fundamentals of Neural Networks**
   - Perceptron and activation functions
   - Forward and backward propagation
2. **Loss Functions and Optimization**
   - Mean Squared Error, Cross-Entropy Loss
   - Gradient Descent (SGD, Momentum, RMSprop, Adam)
3. **Building a Simple Neural Network**
   - Implementing a feedforward neural network
   - Backpropagation and weight updates
4. **Advanced Topics**
   - Regularization techniques (L1, L2, Dropout)
   - Hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, batch size, etc.)
   - Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and deeper architectures
5. **Custom Implementations**
   - Custom activation functions
   - Experimenting with different architectures
6. **Advanced DL models**
   - RNN
   - LSTMS
   - Seq 2 Seq
   - Transformers

## Prerequisites
